# How to connect Wingbot Webchat to any website

## Basic setup

On the example below you can see the minimal setup for connecting the Wingbot webchat to a website.

```html
<link href="https://orchestrator.wingbot.ai/styles/wingbotChat.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>
<div id="chat"></div>
<script>
    window.wingbotChatCmds=window.wingbotChatCmds||[];
    window.wingbotChat=window.wingbotChat||function(){wingbotChatCmds.push(arguments)}
    wingbotChat('init', {
        pageId: '<put your page-id here>',
        contextUserAgentProp: 'ua',
		contextScreenResolutionProp: 'sr'
    }, document.getElementById('chat'));
</script>
<script async src="https://orchestrator.wingbot.ai/wingbotChat.js"></script>
```

<br />
<br />

##### We can split this example code to the 4 main parts:

- **CSS styles**
    - link with the basic webchat theme, working out of the box
    - feel free to create your own and replace it
- **Physical representation**
    - `<div id="chat"></div>` is physical representation of the webchat
    - it can be placed anywhere in your website
- **Webchat configuration**
    - this part is mostly for configuration the webchat configuration
    - `pageId` is mandatory and unique, if you don't know your `pageId` feel free to contact Wingbot support
    - `document.getElementById` can be set to any existing element in the website
- **Source to the webchat code**
    - the last line of the example is link to the actual webchat app
    - please do not download it and/or cache it somewhere in your infrastructure if you want to have the latest and the most secure version of Wingbot webchat


## Dig more deeply into the configuration

As we saw in the example above, webchat is configurable with 3 parameters.

Lets have a look little bit deeply about the configuration right now:

### Webchat commands and parameters:


```Javascript
webchat (
    'init',    // `'init'` command should be always called to start a chat
    element,   // is for the DOM element which is representation of the chat on the page
    config     // object with webchat configurations
);
```
<br />
<br />

There are supported parameters for the config object:


| Parameter |  Default value | Description | Example |
